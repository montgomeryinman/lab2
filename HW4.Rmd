```{r }
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
dim(choco)

library(tidyverse)


ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date, y = count)) + geom_bar()
```

Question Set 1:
1) There are 1852 chocolate bars rated.
2) 



```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating)) + geom_histogram()

ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) + geom_jitter()
```

Question Set 2:

1) The histogram is unimodal and fairly symmetric, with most of the ratings falling between the 2.5 and 4 range. There are a couple of outliers; a couple on the low side of the rating and one being a 5 rating. 

2) Looking at the scatterplot, there does not appear to be a correlation between Cocoa Percentage and the rating given.
